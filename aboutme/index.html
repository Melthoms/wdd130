       <p>I am from Ivory-Coast in West Africa area. I served my mission in Benin Cotonou Mission 2015-2017. Now I am living in Ottawa, Canada.</p> 
       <p>As a French speaker I came here to improve my English fluency, but I early noticed that it isn't suffice to live in English area to automatically speak fluency.</p>
       <p>I have in mind to be the best version of myself, so I love to learn new things no matter what, even though there are sometimes boring things (it is a good discussion topics with my fiance).</p>
